# blendApiAccess

Install Instructions:
- yarn install
- yarn start

Search is run using:
http://localhost:4000/ with any search term
E.g
http://localhost:4000/Steven

Things to Improve with more time:
- Ideally I would have liked to have sorted out a search input field rather than just url param
- No tests
- No storybook components
- Clearly the styling
- This is based off my boiler plate (forked) so it might have unneeded packages etc
- Has extra code for dealing with more than one api left in
